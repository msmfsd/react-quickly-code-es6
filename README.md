# react-quickly-code-es6

Here are some code examples from the excellent Manning e-book React Quickly MEAP v3.

#### They have been refactored by me to pure ES6 classes using .js files instead of .jsx.

The actual book can be found here: <https://www.manning.com/books/react-quickly>

The authors original ES5 code examples were taken from here <https://github.com/azat-co/react>

### Init
```
$ npm install
```

### Build assets
```
$ npm run build
```

### View in browser
```
$ npm run dev
```

#### NOTES:
- Webpack dev server runs on port 8080
- To view the various examples simply replace all the code in the index.js file with one of the example files eg. code-form-refs.js. Then run the build/dev processes again.
